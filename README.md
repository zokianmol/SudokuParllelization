# SudokuParllelization
Trying to make sudoku algorithm parallely
The sole purpose is to minimize the computing time to solve the sudoku parrallely
In this exercise, we would be implementing OpenMp, MPI and CUDA to use parallel programming
First, serial code will be established and checked thoroughly
